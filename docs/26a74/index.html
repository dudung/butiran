Two days ago or Thursday the cleaning process in office room was performed. There was also unpacking activites for previously bought apparatus but not yet used intensively, e.g. Synology DS220 NAS, GW Instek GDS‑1054B, D-Link DGS-1024C, self-assembled PC, Mini PCs, etc. The last ones were still in their box. Daily note and fiction like this one are unmanaged in the day of cleaning. That is th reason why story of is late and written two days after d-day.</p><p><strong><code>55</code></strong>
Yesterday or Saturday is a holiday. Half population was having trip, while the other half was staying at home whole day long. At home the lunch was good but simple. Oven-heating fried chicken and tofu, instant noodle soup, and, of coourse, rice were in the table. One had boiled eggs and previou fried chicken served but without carbo, and the other only water with instant power lemon tea, which has a lot of sugar.</p><p><strong><code>56</code></strong>
The drink that I had yesterday night is thing that should be noted. Drink a lot of water in the night before bed is good as far as observed, but when it is with sugar, it becomes bad. It seems to bind to something as observed that daily weightlos is reduced compared to the day without consuming water with sugar. This must be avoided in the future the sake of the health.</p><p><strong><code>57</code></strong>
I think that is for this morning. This soft of log mixed with fiction is just as note in reminding past event for further elaboration in other notes. It is 0533 and the time for dormant-1 today.</p></div></div></main><footer><link rel=stylesheet href='/butiran/css/footer.css?v=1769939862'><p>Copyright Sparisoma Viridi 2026<a href=/butiran/h2/ style=cursor:text>.</a>
