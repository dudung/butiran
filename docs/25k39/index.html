<a class=link href=npprel:///25/k/39-lost-n-overwhelmed.md>edit</a></div></div><div class=note-content><p>Honesly, I do not know what to do. I am feeling lost and overhelmed. It is not because of the heavy workload of a task, but uncertain load peak of many tasks. All are not regulary updated, but when they are required to process, after triggered by other events, they are entering the queue and the energy to perform all of that is not sufficient. It might seem that I exaggerate it, or it is just because I am exhausted?</p><p>This morning, while writing it, I am in Belitung for
<a href=/butiran/25k33/><span>a visit
</span></a>and it is the same day for
<a href=/butiran/25c16/><span>RKI
</span></a>final report in Padang next week. After that I must go to Ambon for
<a href=/butiran/25j45/><span>other tasks
</span></a>. I just want to have a time for writing, anyting from this note, a story on Medium, or simply a scientific publication. But I have experienced so far is only dealing with information and managing how to store them and how I can retreive them later when required. These, without actually performing the tasks, already absorb the energy a lot. And one of the reason I am developing butiran is to overcome it. The condition is getting better, but not yet at the operational condition with comfortable atmosphere.</p><p>It is now 0518 and this note will be continued via private WAG daily-notes and later merged after supported condition.</p></div></div></main><footer><link rel=stylesheet href='/butiran/css/footer.css?v=1766094395'><p>Copyright Sparisoma Viridi 2025<a href=/butiran/h2/ style=cursor:text>.</a>
